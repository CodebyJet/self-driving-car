# Self-Driving Car Simulation (Work in Progress)

----

## Overview

This project is a work in progress, aiming to create a self-driving car simulation within a customizable world. The goal is to provide a platform where users can implement their own maps, experiment with different scenarios, and witness the development of a self-driving car's functionality.

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-driving-car.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

3. Run the project:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- JavaScript: Core language for the project's functionality.
- jQuery: Used for simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.
- HTML: Provides the basic structure for the project.
- CSS: Used for styling the self-driving car simulation.

## Description

The ultimate vision for this project is to create a self-driving car within a dynamic virtual world. Users will be able to download the simulation and implement their own maps, introducing various challenges and scenarios for the self-driving car to navigate through.

Building upon a previous repository of mine, where users can create custom maps with signs and the car, the current focus is on implementing features such as the ability for the car to stop and recognize markings within the environment. This README serves as an update on the work in progress, providing insights into the development process.

## Project Evolution

### Planning

The initial concept was inspired by a tutorial online created by Radu Mariescu-Istodor. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkI9ia2cLhc&list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY&ab_channel=RaduMariescu-Istodor). This tutorial proved to be a fantastic learning opportunity, offering insights into JavaScript fundamentals, particularly in working with Canvas elements, which were not part of the original project.

### Future Development

The project is a continuous work in progress, with plans to expand on JavaScript fundamentals, enhance the self-driving car's capabilities, and refine the overall simulation experience. Contributions and feedback from the community are welcome as we strive to create a more advanced and realistic self-driving car simulation.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to the development of this exciting project!
